<p>As you can see, this will be my 3rd career path change. Over the years, 
  I have always known that I wanted to help, either animals or people. For me, 
  the only scope that I knew how to do provide this help was through direct work. 
  After working with people in the field of social work for over 8 years, 
  I continued to run into the same problem, I was unable to fix the problems 
  that I ran into. There is a lot of institutionalized roadblocks when it comes to social work,
   not to mention compassion fatigue, burnout, high caseloads and long hours. After some research,
   I learned that I would be able to help others if I transitioned into the field of tech, in fact many
    tech companies are assisting their users every day. I was very hesitant to try to learn to code as tech 
    was never introduced to me as a serious career choice- so I was nervous. After months of self-studying, 
    volunteering at conventions, connecting with developers from many different fields, I was able to get 
    into Hackbright for Full Stack Development and am excited to begin my career in software development.  </p>
